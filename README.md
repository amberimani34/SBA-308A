# SBA-308A
I chose to use the Dog API to create a choose your puppy website.
I added a navigation bar, which I could later create other html pages for but for now you can hover over them.
Then I added a heading, and a drop-down with all the breed selections in the API URL I chose.
When you intially load the page all the available breeds pop up in a pagination state where you can click previous and next to scroll through all the breed images.
When you click a specific breed in the drop-down, then all the images of that specific breed show.
You can still utilize the pagination to scroll through if there are more images than fit on the page. 
I used html and css to create a friendly user experience, and some style to the page.
